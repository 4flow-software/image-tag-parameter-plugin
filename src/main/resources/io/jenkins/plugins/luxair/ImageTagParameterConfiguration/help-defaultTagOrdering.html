<div>
    <p>Enables administrators to define the default tag ordering for any newly created parameter.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Natural Ordering</strong> ... same Ordering as the tags had in prior versions<br/>
        <strong>Reverse Natural Ordering</strong> ... the reversed original ordering<br/>
        <strong>Descending Versions</strong> ... tries to parse the tags as versions and arrange them in descending order.<br/>
        <strong>Ascending Versions</strong> ... attempts to parse the tags to a version and order them ascending.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>WARNING:</strong><br/>
        Be careful when using versioned sorting. This method is most effective with <a href="https://semver.org/">semver</a>
        or Maven version-compliant ImageTags but may not perform optimally with other schemas!<br/>
        The conversion of tags to versions may fail in specific cases, leading to sorting issues and potentially resulting in an empty selection list.
        In such situations, users will receive a notification indicating a parameter misconfiguration.
